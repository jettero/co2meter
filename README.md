# CO2meter

This CO2meter object is ripped from vfilimonov/co2meter, renamed to CO2meter
(from CO2monitor). There's a bunch more docs over there (install docs, udev
rules notes, monitoring server setup, etc), flask app, matplotlib plotter and
other gadgets I didn't want.

# My actual contribution

I just wanted a tool to spit out json. I can import that into Splunk or whatever
and make graphs in there.
